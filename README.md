#  A Very Simple Machine Learning Application: A Group Project.
## Brief Summary: 

We use a Machine Learning module that we access via an API (Application Programming Interface) request. We also make use of the Streamlit library. The idea at large was that the user uploads data into a database and the user can then reach the saved information that is sorted under the name of the applicant. The simple database used is SQLite. The applicants data can then be used in order to answer very simple questions that are connected to the text copied into the Streamlit. For example, what if HR (Human Resources) wanted to easily access different data and not have to read through all of the text that the user provides within a textfile. HR then are able to ask questions and the Machine Learning tool provides a probability. 

## Build Status:

Completed. 

No bugs or errors in need of addressing. 

## Code Style:

Standard. The code follows coding conventions for Python by using PEP8 framework. 

## Screenshots:

## Tech/Framework used:

Streamlit, Pandas, Sqlite3. 

## Features: 

The application can search through a textfile and with machine learning answer some questions. We used it in a HR situation but the API can answer more   

## Code Examples:

## Installation:

You need to import the following modules into python: Streamlit, Pandas, and Sqlit3. This is a guide on how to import modules into python.

## API reference:

Not available at the moment. 

## Tests:

This is the section where you mention all the different tests that can be performed with code examples

## User-guide:

1. Open the python file main.py. 

2. Enter this in terminal: streamlit run main.py 

3. Default is to add a new candidate then enter name. Enter CV in textform and then press upload.

4. If you have done this, the entering of the data, and want to review the candidates and ask questions use the "select box" to change section to the question part.
