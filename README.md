#  A very simple Machine Learning Application: A Group Project.
## Brief Summary: 

We use a Machine Learning module that we access via an API (Application Programming Interface) request. We also make use of the Streamlit library. The idea at large was that the user uploads data into a database and the user can then reach the saved information that is sorted under the name of the applicant. The simple database used is SQLite. The applicants data can then be used in order to answer very simple questions that are connected to the text copied into the Streamlit. For example, what if HR (Human Resources) wanted to easily access different data and not have to read through all of the text that the user provides within a textfile. HR then are able to ask questions and the Machine Learning tool provides a probability. 

## Build Status:

Completed. No buss or errors in need of addressing. 

## Code Style:

Standard. The code follows coding conventions for Python by using PEP8 framework. 

## Screenshots: 

Add screenshot tomorrow. 

## Tech/Framework used:

Machine Learning. APi. Python Library. 

This is used to help the reader understand which tech or frameworks have been used to do the project. It helps the reader understand which all tech stack he has to be familiar with to understand the whole project.
Features
This is where you write what all extra features have been done in your project. Basically this is where you try to make your project stand out from the rest.
Code Examples
This is where you try to compress your project and make the reader understand what it does as simply as possible. This should help the reader understand if your code solves their issue.
Installation
If your project needs installation of certain software or configurations to the system. Do mention it in this section as it helps a lot for the reader to use your project. The steps mentioned should be precise and explanatory.  If possible, you can add links that can help them better understand how to configure/install the necessary files or softwares.
API reference
If your project is small, then we can add the reference docs in the readme. For larger projects, it is better to provide links to where the API reference documentation is documented.
Tests
This is the section where you mention all the different tests that can be performed with code examples
How to Use?
As I have mentioned before, you never know who is going to read your readme. So it is better to provide information on how to use your project. A step-by-step guide is best suited for this purpose. It is better to explain steps as detailed as possible because it might be a beginner who is reading it.
Contribute
This is where you let them know that they can contribute and help you out. A guideline on how to contribute is also helpful
Credits
Giving proper credit is most important. Mention any links/repos which helped you or inspired you to build this project. It can be a blog, another open source project, or just people who have contributed in building this project.
