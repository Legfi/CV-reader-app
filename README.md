#  A Very Simple Machine Learning Application: A Group Project.
## Brief Summary: 

We use a Machine Learning module that we access via an API (Application Programming Interface) request. We also make use of the Streamlit library. The idea at large was that the user uploads data into a database and the user can then reach the saved information that is sorted under the name of the applicant. The simple database used is SQLite. The applicants data can then be used in order to answer very simple questions that are connected to the text copied into the Streamlit. For example, what if HR (Human Resources) wanted to easily access different data and not have to read through all of the text that the user provides within a textfile. HR then are able to ask questions and the Machine Learning tool provides a probability. 

## Build Status:

Completed. 

No bugs or errors in need of addressing. 

## Code Style:

Standard. The code follows coding conventions for Python by using PEP8 framework. 

## Screenshots: 

Add screenshot tomorrow. 

## Tech/Framework used:

Streamlit, Pandas, Sqlite3. 

## Features: 

## Code Examples:

## Installation:

You need to import the following modules into python: Streamlit, Pandas, and Sqlit3. This is a guide on how to import modules into python.

## API reference:

Insert documentation for API. 

## Tests:

This is the section where you mention all the different tests that can be performed with code examples

## User-guide:

As I have mentioned before, you never know who is going to read your readme. So it is better to provide information on how to use your project. A step-by-step guide is best suited for this purpose. It is better to explain steps as detailed as possible because it might be a beginner who is reading it.

## Contribute:

If you want to contribute to the code and this project it is made possible by commiting new code to github.
